Uh, stuff:
[0] Added ol' char-layout (e.g: l11ll1111l1 (I'll add an parameter to change char-layout l8r))
[1] Added string obfuscation (cough string.dump cough (cough char to int, int to string cough) ((cough buggy cough))


Bugs:
[0] It'll fuck more things up, that's why I've forked luaobf repo. (e.g: https://vgy.me/mt9W2d.png fml)
